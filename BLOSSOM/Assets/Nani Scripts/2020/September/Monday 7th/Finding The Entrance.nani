; School has ended. You help Oscar cheer up on the playground behind the school. You both walk together to go to the bus. On the way you walk past the remnants of a WW2 bunker, it would've been used during the Blitz. The entrance is ajar. As you walk past, a voice calls to you. Compels you. You've heard it before? Surely? You investigate. You hear Oscar's voice ask you not to go inside. You feel him tug on your arm. You ignore him. You enter. He follows. You're both caught back by a faint white glow on the other side of the bunker. A short pillar of light? As you approach, it opens up - a brightly-lit, modern-looking elevator. Oscar tries to plead with you one last time to ignore it. You know you can't. He sheepishly follows you into the elevator. There are seemingly hundreds of buttons on the panel - you know which one to press. You and Oscar descend for what feels like minutes. The door opens and you step out.
